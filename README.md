my understanding of html code
I created a navigation button that allows users to navigate the site.
A table with rows and columns that fill user information in.
I created a basic contact form with; the users name, email, a message, and a submit button.
I added images.
I completed all of the bonuses including; the rounded image, the table colum heading, the radio button that asks where the user heard of us.
i used unpreordered list and oredered lists to add and organize information.
the entire page was built using HTML syntax 5
the code quality was of good standard and with crystal clear readability.
comments were added to allow the reader a defined path.
